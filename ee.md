We can understand transistor by considering that
when Vgs < Vthreshold, the transistor acts an open circuit
and otherwise it acts as wire.

## NMOS
In particular, for a NMOS transistor, current flows
from the drain to the source whenever Vgs > threshold.

## PMOS
For a PMOS transistor, current flows from the
source to the drain whenever Vsg > threshold.

They key point is that if Vgs > threshold,
there's only one place where where Id = 0,
which is when Vds = 0. This makes it easy to understand,
for example, the inverter CMOS circuit.
