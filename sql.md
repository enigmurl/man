# Sql

## Querying
### basics


### Joins
Most commonly want inner join, but also stuff such as cross join exists

### where clause

note cannot be used with aggregates

### group by and having

While COUNT usually counts the total number of rows, it may instead be desired to count a subset of rows that satisfy some property, say share the same column
HAVING connects with group by to filter on aggregates

### with clause

used for temporaries
